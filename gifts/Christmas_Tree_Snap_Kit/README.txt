# Summary

I really enjoy all the snap kits people have been making and wanted to try make one myself. With Christmas around the corner, I thought a tree would make for an easy first kit. I did not stay within the confines of business card size...but you could scale down if you want. Just make sure to constrain all proportions, so the tolerances remain. If this version doesn't scale well, let me know. I could optimize it for smaller print beds.

# Post-Printing

I just threw some cheap paints I got from Micheal's on mine. It's super easy and really makes the little tree stand out.
