# Replacement Lids To Turn Talenti Ice Cream Jars Into Lens Bubbles

this is a set of replacement lits for Talenti 10.8 ounce ice cream jars.  The jars themselves are clear plastic, and have HDPE 2 lids.

If you turn them upside down they look a lot like the plastic lens bubbles that frequently were used by Nikon, Leica and others in the 60's and 70's.

Plastic lens bubbles are a much better way to keep your lenses because they don't enable mold or fungus the way cardboard, felt and leatherette cases do.

The designs in this directory then, are replacement lids that you print which have a rear-lens-cap for a particular mount molded into it.

In the scad files, you can also add some text, and the first line is printed on the outside flat surface, along the rim, and inside the lid.

The actual lens mount stl files were found on thingiverse and just repositioned into the basic threaded lid design which I created.
