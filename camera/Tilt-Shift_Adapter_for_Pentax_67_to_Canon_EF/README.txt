# Summary

A Tilt-Shift adapter for using Pentax 6x7 lenses on Canon EF mount cameras.

Shift and tilt can be set between plus/minus 17mm and 12.5 degree, respectively. I use it with the Pentax 6x7 1:4 55mm and an Canon 6D or 5DM2. The grip of the camera will interfere with tilt to the right but by rotating the camera one can get around that limitation for compositions. 

Integrated a lock for the Pentax lens that uses a spring from a pen. Mount the adapter on the camera first and make sure it locks securely. To mount an Pentax lens first insert the lens with the red marker lined up with small marker on the adapter and turn to the large marker on top and make sure it is locked as well. Set the lens to manual aperture operation.

I used Cabonfiber PETG at 0.1 mm resolution and a 0.4 mm nozzle for strength and precision and the adapter turned out very solid. Print the EF adapter at 0.1mm layer height without support (EF2 final). Rest could be printed at 0.15mm. You need to make sure that you have excellent layer adhesion here because of the weights involved. The lens I use is 750 gram and the camera is 770 gram. So be careful and make sure all is locked securely. 

All contact areas have to be wet sanded with 400 grid until fitting together and moving smoothly. Height should be 40.95 mm from top to lower attachment site after assembly.
