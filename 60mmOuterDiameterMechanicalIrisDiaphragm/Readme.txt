# Printing notes (FDM printers)

Print the blades flat (pin sides up) with a layer height of 0.2 mm.

Print housing flat. Layer height: 0.2 mm

Print actuator ring flat. Layer height: 0.2 mm

Print clip flat. Layer height: 0.2 mm



# Assembly

Bend the blade pins back on themselves along the 'waist' line, to enable the blade to have a pin on both sides. Add a small drop of Super Glue to hold it in place. Example video: https://youtu.be/vECdT-8V1kA

Starting with the actuator ring, insert the blades in an overlapping fashion (on the flat side). Once you have them all in, line them up along the ring in their maximum aperture position.

With the housing upside-down and the handle pointing to the right, carefully place it over the blades so the the handle lines up against the slot edge furthest away from you. Carefully jiggle the handle so that the pins drop into all the slots.

Turn the whole thing over and make sure everything is in place (jiggle the handle again if some pins have not dropped in, you can also use something pointy to encourage the stubborn ones).

Gently close the iris a little to make sure it functions freely.

Finally, insert the clip to retain everything in place.

If the action is a little stiff, try rubbing pencil lead over the bearing surfaces – such as the actuator ring, slots, and inner wall of the housing.

# Troubleshooting

The aperture is not circular.
Try replacing the problem blade/s.

The mechanism is tight or not smooth.
Try rubbing a pencil on all the surfaces that rub. This includes the slots, inside surfaces of the housing, the blade side of the actuator ring, and the inside of the clip.
